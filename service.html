                    <p>Put on our school's 2nd consecutive 8th Grade Valentine's Day Dance with all proceeds going towards the 
                        American Heart Association, a nonprofit that funds research for heart disease and related conditions  </p>

                <p>Had the opportunity to volunteer for 3 years with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and was on 
                    the leading team of 15 students getting to present the fundraiser to K-6 students my final year. The organization
                    funds research for Leukemia and supports patients and their families financially. Our school 
                    raised over $15,000 in 3 years for LLS with half of that amount coming from the year our team led. Glad to
                    say that even more was raised in conjunction with my high school the year after my class graduated

                <p>Volunteered for summer events with my church at the Texas Baptist Children's Home, a place that provides a home, needs and beyond for orphans. 
                    Getting to meet and mentor the kids was often a humbling experience and at times I enjoyed the experience of running soccer games and holding group
                    talk more than they did at times
